Hi,
I'm a researcher at the [Division of Genetic Epidemiology](http://genepi.i-med.ac.at), [Medical University of Innsbruck](http://www.i-med.ac.at) and part of a small subgroup, the HS**L**ab. 

We mainly focus on software development and try to increase the [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) usage in Genetics. Check out my [Scholar profile](http://scholar.google.at/citations?user=xx6B8OUAAAAJ&hl=de) for publications. 

## Current projects
- [Cloudgene](http://cloudgene.uibk.ac.at) - A workflow system for Hadoop.

- [Imputationserver](https://imputationserver.sph.umich.edu/) - Imputation Service based on [minimac3](http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/Minimac3) and Cloudgene. A cooperation with the [Center of Statistical Genetics](http://csg.sph.umich.edu/abecasis/), University of Michigan.

- [Haplogrep](http://haplogrep.uibk.ac.at) - mtDNA haplogroup classification using Phylotree. A cooperation with the [Databases and Information Systems Group](https://dbis-informatik.uibk.ac.at/) at the University of Innsbruck.

- [mtDNA-Server](http://mtdna-server.uibk.ac.at) - A NGS heteroplasmy and contamination pipeline based on Cloudgene. Including a parallelized version of BWA MEM.

- [Askimed](http://www.askimed.com) - Electronic data collection for phenotypes. Used in the EU FP7 project [ncRNAPain](http://ec.europa.eu/research/health/medical-research/brain-research/projects/ncrnapain_en.html) and in the German Chronic Kidney Disease Study [GCKD](http://www.gckd.org).
