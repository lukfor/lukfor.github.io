PedVizApi is a Java API (application program interface) for the visual analysis of large and complex pedigrees. It provides all the necessary functionality for the interactive exploration of extended genealogies. While available packages are mostly focused on a static representation or cannot be added to an existing application, PedVizApi is a highly flexible open source library for the efficient construction of visual-based applications for the analysis of family data. An extensive demo application and a R interface is provided.
