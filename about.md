Hi,
I'm a resarcher at the [Division of Genetic Epidemiology](http://genepi.i-med.ac.at) and part of the HS**L**ab. We mainly focus on open-source tool development and try to bring Hadoop to Genetics. Check out my [Scholar profile](http://scholar.google.at/citations?user=xx6B8OUAAAAJ&hl=de) for publications.
